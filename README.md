FileExtracxy is a Python tool that extracts URLs from a JSON file and saves them to an output text file. 
The user can choose to extract full URLs (including parameters) or just the domain names. 
This tool is useful for anyone who needs to collect or analyze links from large JSON datasets, 
especially when dealing with web scraping, data extraction, or API responses that contain URLs.

## **Features**
âœ… **Extracts URLs** from JSON files, including nested structures.  
âœ… **Allows full URLs or just domains extraction.**  
âœ… **Appends results** to an output file without overwriting.  
âœ… **Interactive, colorful terminal UI** using `colorama` and `tqdm`.
